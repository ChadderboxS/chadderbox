# Images Directory

This directory is for storing image assets for your personal website.

## Usage

Images stored here can be referenced in your components using absolute paths starting with `/images/`.

For example, if you store an image at `public/images/profile.jpg`, you can reference it in your components as:

\`\`\`jsx
<img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile" />
\`\`\`

## Organization

Consider organizing images into subdirectories based on their purpose:
- `/images/profile/` - For personal photos
- `/images/projects/` - For project screenshots
- `/images/logos/` - For logos and icons
\`\`\`

Let's create a sample image placeholder to demonstrate how to use images:
